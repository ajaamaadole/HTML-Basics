(Verse 1) On the first Day of Christmas, my true love sent to me 
    A partridge in a pear tree
    [Verse 2]
On the second day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
Two turtle doves, and
A partridge in a pear tree

[Verse 3]
On the third day of Christmas, my true love sent to me
Three french hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree.
